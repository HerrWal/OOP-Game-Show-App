# OOP-Game-Show-App
A browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." created using OOP principles

For the second step of the Extra Credit I made some changes for the background colors of all the overlays and the body. I also changed the color of the keys and letters. The fonts stay the same. I also added hover effects (mainly border shadows) to the buttons.

I like dark colors combined with purple and gold.
